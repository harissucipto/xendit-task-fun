# Testing APIs with Cypress

to test the APIs, we need to run Cypress.

First run server with `make server`;

second, navigate to directory folder `testing-apis-with-cypress`;

then run `npm install`

after that run `npm run test`

## Note

dont forget to change config on `cypress.json` file to run on specific port or when you want to change the enviroment.
